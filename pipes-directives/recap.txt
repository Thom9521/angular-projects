1. What is the purpose of the *ngIf directive? 
- Like the normal conditional statement "if". It can be used to display a 
block of text if something is living up to the condition.

2. What is the purpose of the *ngIfElse directive?
- It goes along with the *ngIf. It can display another block of a text if the 
condition in *ngIf isn't true.

3. What is the purpose of the *ngSwitch directive?
- Works kinda like *ngIf, but the switch has some default conditional values where
it will return default values. It gives a more clear look if the conditions and the values to return
is always the same.

4. What is the purpose of the ng-content directive? 
- We can make components where we use the ng-content to display a chosen text with the
content values from the component. It can work with bootstrap classes or normal css, that
is only defined in that component.

5. What is the purpose of the pipes? 
- We use pipes to translate a value into another value. 

6. How can you make your own pipes?
- Make a pipe file like replace.pipe.ts that in this example takes the replace() and
using it in the chosen components html.
